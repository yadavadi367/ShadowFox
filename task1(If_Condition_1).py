# Write a program to determine the BMI Category based on user input. Ask the user to:Enter height in meters, Enter weight in kilograms. Calculate BMI sing the formula: BMI = weight / (height)2Use the following categories:If BMI is 30 or greater, print "Obesity"If BMI is between 25 and 29, print "Overweight"If BMI is between 18.5 and 25, print "Normal"If BMI is less than 18.5, print "Underweight"
# Example: Enter height in meters: 1.75Enter weight in kilograms: 70Output: "Normal"

# Take input from the user
height = float(input("Enter height in meters: "))
weight = float(input("Enter weight in kilograms: "))

# Calculate BMI
bmi = weight / (height ** 2)

# Determine BMI category
if bmi >= 30:
    print("Obesity")
elif bmi >= 25:
    print("Overweight")
elif bmi >= 18.5:
    print("Normal")
else:
    print("Underweight")
