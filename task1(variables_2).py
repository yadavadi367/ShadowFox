#Create a variable called for and assign it a value 4. See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you see.

for = 4

#RESULT
#SyntaxError: invalid syntax
#The reason for this error is that "for" is a reserved keyword in Python, used for creating loops. You cannot use it as a variable name. To fix this, you can choose a different variable name that is not a reserved keyword.
